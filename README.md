# Alura-POO

This is a repository of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) practice in Java. The goal is to learn the basics of OOP, such as classes, objects, attributes, methods, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

The repository contains several classes that represent entities of a mini-bank, such as accounts, cards, transactions, customers, and employees. There are also some classes that simulate test data, such as packages and vehicles.

To run the code, you need to have Java installed and an IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA. The program's entry point is the Main class, which creates some objects from the repository classes and displays their properties and behaviors.

This repository is for educational purposes only and does not claim to be a real banking system.
